## Notes
Sprint
Definition: 8
-Sometimes the task do not define the user story (Implementing snip identification for the mouse cursor being the focal point for zooming)

Splitting: 8
-Differences quite big (Daniel vs Bjorn for example)

Responsibility: 10

Reflection
Reflection: 7
-Tests should be done per PR
-Problem #3 means that the task was not thought out very well

Estimation: 8

Priority: 7
-Should have put a higher priority on fixing tooling errors if you wanted that done before the deadline
-Use A-E. Right now the higher priorities are well defined, but people are working on multiple A tasks. What should their priority be in that?

Architecture
Changes: 9
Document: 8
-No new version
-Same feedback as last week

CQ: 6
-Unused code should be deleted (loads of unused/dead variables)
-DBM, stage and nwkTree should not be static
-Check out lambda expressions
-Lots of FXML unused
-Use a logging framework

Readability
Formatting: 7
Naming: 9
Comments: 7
-Same laps of code remain
-Comments missing 
-All of the above should be fixed in code review

CI
Building: 9
Testing: 9

Tooling: 9
-Minor errors left

PBD
Branching: 10
Code Review: 8
-Make sure to check every PR on all points above (readability, testing, tooling, etc) This prevents things like last second tooling fixes before the deadline.

## Announcements
We will not have the regular SE Meeting next Friday because of the Serial Meetings we will have with Bacchelli. You will need to prepare a 10-15 minute demo and sell your product. 
 
Besides that please fill in this survey for your feedback on me [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eprgikpJsNbVj6x0CDLeKqxsdnkfd1P9k9Qdn8kkqr8/viewform#start=openform)
