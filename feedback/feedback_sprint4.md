## Notes
sprint:
-splitting: Big difference in hours (7 hours for some people)


reflection:
-prio: Use larger scale (A-E), lots of Cs.

EAD:
-Include interactions in subsystem in the overview
-Elaborate on your design goals in subsystem: Why does this subsystem help in achieving this?

EAD-Changes:
-split biggest parts in modules

CQ:
-Almost same feedback as last week

Formatting:
-Still see big laps of code

Naming:
-Same problems as last week

Comments:
-Spotted some outdated comments

CI:
-Testing: Too little

Tooling:
-Findbugs, CPD, PMD errors
