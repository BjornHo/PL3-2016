## Notes
Sprint
Definition: 7

- At this stage testing should not be a part of the sprint plan anymore
- There is no way the giant refactoring task could be split? How do you split this task amongst yourselves?

Splitting: 10

Responsibility: 10

Reflection
Estimation: 5

- I don't understand problem #2. What work had to be finished first? Or are you telling me that you did 23 hours of research?

Prioritisation: 8

- Won't the refactoring affect all other work? (higher priority than the rest)

Reflection: 5

- If fixing the Travis errors fixed the Maven errors, why are there hours allocated for the Maven errors?
- Reactions do not describe how the problems will be prevented in the future.

Code Evolution
Architecture
Changes: 9
Document: 7

- No new version
- Feedback should be implemented

CQ: 5

- Same feedback that should be implemented

Code Readability
Formatting: 8
Naming: 9
Comments: 6

- Outdated and incomplete comments
- Formatting not always good

CI
Building: 9
Testing: 9

Tooling: 8

- CPD has errors

PBD
Branching: 7
Code Review: 10

- Lots of branches open that are getting behind (cleanup branches)
