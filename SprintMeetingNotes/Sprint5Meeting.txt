Group 4:
-Collapses snips into squares and deletions into triangles.
-Has a separate scene on the right of the graph with a list of phylogenetic tree genomes.

Group 5:
-Uses 2 subgraphs next to each other to show the differences between two strands.

Thomas:
-Wants to select strains that have a certain property (such as drug resistance) and have them all highlighted.
-If you select 2 genomes from the phylogeny tree, only show those two in the graph, colour them by lineage and highlight the *differences*.
-Zooming is using the mouse wheel. If you have to zoom using the keyboard, he considers it as having no zoom function at all.
-Use vertical space (Like, if a lot of genomes go through a top segment in a snip, move this top snip further upwards.
-Colour the lines in the phylogenetic tree according to their lineage.
-Search function in phylo tree.
-Keep track of context; “Where am I?”
-Semantic zooming is way more important than loading in the 6k gfa file. Without semantic zooming the entire app is useless.
-Top level view is entire graph (!).
